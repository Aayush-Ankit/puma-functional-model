pytorch_sample.py has a simple example inputs and weights matrix, and a simple network.
By the command 'python pytorch_sample.py', you can run the code. 

Conv2d_mvm is the custom module defined in pytorch_mvm_class.py




To Indranil & Mustafa

run your code with '-i' command like:
"python pytorch_sample -i"
And then for loops in mvm_tensor will work.
